    Summary

I am a full-stack generalist web developer most comfortable in open-source languages, most recently Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. I'm conversant and literate in Mandarin Chinese and always interested in learning more languages (both human and computer). I am one of the (apparently) few people in this world who love regular expressions. My hobbies include cycling, word games, and photography.


    Objective

I want to continue using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and related frameworks in a test-driven environment. I value organized code and enjoy refactoring existing code as much as writing new features, so it's important to me to work on a team that respects code organization and cleanliness. After spending three months pair programming, I appreciate its usefulness in a team that can embrace it.


    Skills

Programming languages, frameworks, databases:

*  Most comfortable in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Backbone.js, and jQuery
*  Also very comfortable with Python, PHP, Perl, and bash
*  Most comfortable with MySQL and PostgreSQL
*  Familiar with MongoDB

General web development:

*  Proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript best practices
*  Practiced in test-driven development using RSpec and Jasmine
*  Experienced implementing whole-site redesigns and new features and interactivity based on low-fidelity mockups and conversations with designers and site users
*  I enjoy collaborating on user experience improvements and concerns with designers during planning stages of site design and features
*  Comfortable using version control systems to collaborate with other developers
*  Strong attention to W3C standards, browser independence, user accessibility, as well as code efficiency
*  I particularly enjoy creating and dissecting regular expressions

    Fun Facts

*  My family is not named after self-replicating code; the code is named after my family.

*  I have been typing in Dvorak, an alternative keyboard layout, since 2003.

*  I'm a lover of human languages as well: I'm conversant and literate in Mandarin Chinese, was fluent in French in high school and could scrape by in Italian, can transliterate Cyrillic and some Arabic. My "to tackle next" list is Arabic, Swahili, and Lojban.

*  I'm an avid photographer, both film and digital, and particularly fond of long (multi-hour) exposures and piecing together wide panoramas.

*  I enjoy etymology, eagerly-hyphenated compound modifiers, and the serial comma.
