    Summary

I am a full-stack generalist web developer most comfortable in open-source languages, such as Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. I'm conversant and literate in Mandarin Chinese and always interested in learning more languages (both human and computer). I am one of the (apparently) few people in this world who love regular expressions. My hobbies include cycling, word games, and photography.


    Objective

I want to continue using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and related frameworks in a test-driven environment. I value organized code and enjoy refactoring existing code as much as writing new features, so it's important to me to work on a team that respects code organization and cleanliness. I enjoy pair programming in teams that work well together. I love the San Francisco Bay Area and while working remotely is not out of the question, I find it much easier to communicate when people are face-to-face.

*  Most comfortable in Ruby on Rails, and Javascript with Backbone.js or jQuery
*  Also very comfortable with Python, PHP, Perl, bash
